# Instructions

When cloning or checking out the project, there is an action to complete at first. This is a very important step because there are also checks being performed on the server that could fail the commit / PR if this is not done.

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project
    * On **windows**, use the **Git Bash** - **right click** on the repository folder and select **Git bash Here**
2. Run **make init**
3. Local hooks are configured
